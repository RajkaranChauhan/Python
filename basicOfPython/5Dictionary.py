# Dictionary is same as Hashmap in java, it uses key value pair
# dict can have any data type of key and values


dic = {1: "one", "two": 2, "name": "raj"}
print(dic[1])  # one
print(dic["two"])  # 2
print(dic["name"])  # raj


# Creating dictionary dynamically
dist ={}
dist["first_name"] = "Raj"
dist["last_name"] = "Karan"
dist["gender"] = "male"

print(dist)
print(dist["gender"])
